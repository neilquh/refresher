          <p>Warriors coach Steve Kerr said one of the biggest keys in the game was the Clippers grabbing 16 offensive rebounds and having a 27-11 advantage in second-chance points.

“With the way our roster is right now, we're vulnerable on the glass,” Kerr said. "I thought the Clippers played a great game. Steph was sublime. It was incredible to watch him play tonight. It was a great, great game. We just came up short.”</p>

          <p>Curry tied a season high in points with the 12th 50-point game of his career. He was 20 of 28 and made eight 3-pointers.

            “It’s nice to play and shoot well. It is what I expect to do every night," Curry said. "No matter what the stat sheet looks like after the game, it’s just frustrating when you can’t get over the hump and figure out a way to get a win.”</p>

            <p>The Warriors start the 2022 season with the same starting lineup they ended last season with in Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Kevon Looney, Andrew Wiggins, and Klay Thompson.Key rotational pieces on this roster include 3rd year SG Jordan Poole and seasoned, 4-time champion Andre Igoudala. Perhaps most notable about the Warriors roster, though, is the number of young, high upside players they have. Namely, Jonathan Kuminga, Moses Moody and Patrick Baldwin Jr, all of whom are under age 21.</p>
